# Open reimplementation of the Quan Sheng UV-K5 v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a cloned and customized version of DualTachyon's open firmware found here ..

https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware .. a cool achievement !

Use this firmware/code ENTIRELY at your own risk. This firmware is totally experimental, and at
times will go completely tits up (ie, break your radio) - an entirely common occurance when playing
around with experimental code.

There is absolutely no guarantee that it will work in any way shape or form on your radio(s), it may
even brick your radio(s), at which point, maybe find a quiet corner to sob your hert out in.

NO REFUNDS, ever !
 
## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception anything but
easy (AM mode will suffer far more than FM ever will), the receiver simply doesn't have a
great dynamic range, which results in distorted AM audio with stronger RX'ed signals.
There is nothing more anyone can do in firmware/software to improve that, once the RX gain
adjustment I do (AM fix) reaches the hardwares limit, your AM RX audio will be all but
non-existant (just like Quansheng's firmware).
On the other hand, FM RX audio will/should be fine.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

# User customization

You can customize the firmware by enabling/disabling various compile options, this allows
us to remove certain firmware features in order to make room in the flash for others.
You'll find the options at the top of "Makefile" ('0' = remove code, '1' = include code) ..

```
ENABLE_CLANG                     := 0     **experimental, builds with clang instead of gcc (LTO will be disabled if you enable this)
ENABLE_SWD                       := 0       only needed if using CPU's SWD port (debugging/programming)

ENABLE_RESET_AES_KEY             := 1       '1' = reset/clear the AES key stored in the eeprom (only if it's set)

ENABLE_SMALL_BOLD                := 1       bold channel name/no. (when name + freq channel display mode)
ENABLE_TRIM_TRAILING_ZEROS       := 1       trim away any trailing zeros on frequencies
ENABLE_KEEP_MEM_NAME             := 1       maintain channel name when (re)saving memory channel
ENABLE_WIDE_RX                   := 1       full 18MHz to 1300MHz RX (though front-end/PA not designed for full range)
ENABLE_TX_WHEN_AM                := 0       allow TX (always FM) when RX is set to AM
ENABLE_F_CAL_MENU                := 0       enable/disable the radios hidden frequency calibration menu
ENABLE_TX_UNLOCK                 := 0       allow TX everywhere EXCEPT airband (108~137) .. TX harmonic content will cause interference to other services, do so entirely at your own risk !

ENABLE_AM_FIX                    := 1       dynamically adjust the front end gains when in AM mode to help prevent AM demodulator saturation, ignore the on-screen RSSI level (for now)
ENABLE_AM_FIX_SHOW_DATA          := 1       show debug data for the AM fix (still tweaking it)
ENABLE_SQUELCH_MORE_SENSITIVE    := 1       make squelch levels a little bit more sensitive - I plan to let user adjust the values themselves
ENABLE_SQ_OPEN_WITH_UP_DN_BUTTS  := 1       open the squelch when holding down UP or DN buttons when in frequency mode
ENABLE_FASTER_CHANNEL_SCAN       := 1       increase the channel scan speed, but also make the squelch more twitchy
ENABLE_COPY_CHAN_TO_VFO_TO_CHAN  := 1       long press M, copy channel to VFO, or VFO to channel
ENABLE_RX_SIGNAL_BAR             := 1       enable a menu option for showing an RSSI bar graph
ENABLE_TX_TIMEOUT_BAR            := 0       show the remainng TX time
ENABLE_TX_AUDIO_BAR              := 1       enable a menu option for showing a TX audio level bar
ENABLE_SIDE_BUTT_MENU            := 1       enable menu option for configuring the programmable side buttons
ENABLE_KEYLOCK                   := 1       enable keylock menu option + keylock code
#ENABLE_BAND_SCOPE               := 0       not yet implemented - spectrum/pan-adapter
#ENABLE_SINGLE_VFO_CHAN          := 0       not yet implemented - single VFO on display when possible
```

# New/modified function keys

* Long-press 'M' .. Copy selected channel into same VFO, then switch VFO to frequency mode
*
* Long-press '7' .. Toggle selected channel scanlist setting .. if VOX  is disabled in Makefile
* or
* Long-press '5' .. Toggle selected channel scanlist setting .. if NOAA is disabled in Makefile
*
* Long-press '*' .. Start scanning, then toggles the scanning between scanlists 1, 2 or ALL channels

# Edit channel/memory name

1. Press Menu button
2. Scroll to "CH NAM" (around number 17)
3. Press the Menu button to enter
4. Use up/down keys to choose the desired channel to edit
5. Press the Menu button again to enter edit name mode
6. Use the up/down keys to cycle through the letters etc
7. Press the Menu button again to move to the next character position
8. Repeat steps 6 and/or 7 till you reach the end
9. When it pops up the "Sure?" text, press Menu button to save, or Exit to cancel

Press the Exit button at any time to cancel the edit and return to the main menu.

Sounds a lot/complicated but once you done it a couple of times you'll be fine (hopefully).

When you're editing the name, you can enter digits (0 ~ 9) directly without having to use the up/down
buttons to find them.

# Some changes made from the Quansheng firmware

* Various Quansheng firmware bugs fixed
* Added new bugs
* Mic menu includes max gain possible
* AM RX everywhere (left the TX as is)
* An attempt to improve the AM RX audio (demodulator getting saturated/overloaded in Quansheng firmware)
* keypad-5/NOAA button now toggles scanlist-1 on/off for current channel when held down - IF NOAA not used
* Better backlight times (inc always on)
* Live DTMF decoder option, though the decoder needs some coeff tuning changes to decode other radios it seems
* Various menu re-wordings (trying to reduce 'WTH does that mean ?')
* AIRCOPY RX'ing radio now requests packet resends from TX'ing radio if RX'ed packet is lost/corrupted
* ..

# Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

clang may be used but isn't fully supported. Resulting binaries may also be bigger.
You can get it from: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html

# Building

To build the firmware, you need to fetch the submodules and then run make:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1
make
```

To compile directly in windows without the need of a linux virtual machine:

```
1. Download and install "gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.exe" from https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm
2. Download and install "gnu_make-3.81.exe" from https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm

3. You may need to (I didn't) manualy add gcc path to your OS environment PATH.
   ie add C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain\10 2021.10\bin

4. You may need to reboot your PC after installing the above
```

Then you can run 'win_make.bat' from the directory you saved this source code too.
You may need to edit the bat file (path to make.exe) depending on where you installed the above two packages too.

I've left some notes in the win_make.bat file to maybe help with stuff.

# WARNING if trying to use K5/K6 to TX out of band ..

Most of the radios TX energy is concentrated into the harmonics and other spurious carriers rather than within the fundamental ..

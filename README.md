# Open reimplementation of the Quan Sheng UV-K5 v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a cloned and customized version of DualTachyon's open firmware found here ..

https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware

A cool achievement

# User customization

You can customize the firmware by enabling/disabling various compile options.
You'll find the options at the top of "Makefile" ('0' = disable, '1' = enable) ..

```
ENABLE_SWD                    := 0       only needed if using CPU's SWD port (debugging/programming)
ENABLE_OVERLAY                := 1       cpu FLASH stuff
ENABLE_UART                   := 1       without this you can't configure radio via PC (38400 bps Baud)
ENABLE_AIRCOPY                := 0       easier to just enter frequency
ENABLE_FMRADIO                := 0       WBFM VHF band 2 RX
ENABLE_NOAA                   := 0       Everything NOAA
ENABLE_VOICE                  := 0       want to hear voices ?
ENABLE_ALARM                  := 0       TX alarms
ENABLE_BIG_FREQ               := 0       big font frequencies
ENABLE_KEEP_MEM_NAME          := 1       maintain channel name when (re)saving memory channel
ENABLE_WIDE_RX                := 1       full 18MHz to 1300MHz RX (though frontend not tuned over full range)
ENABLE_TX_WHEN_AM             := 0       allow TX (always FM) when RX is set to AM
ENABLE_CTCSS_TAIL_PHASE_SHIFT := 1       standard CTCSS tail phase shift rather than QS's own 55Hz tone method
ENABLE_MAIN_KEY_HOLD          := 1       initial F-key press not needed, instead hold down keys 0-9 to access the functions
ENABLE_BOOT_BEEPS             := 0       give user audio feedback on volume knob position at boot-up
ENABLE_COMPANDER              := 1       compander option (per channel)
ENABLE_SHOW_CHARGE_LEVEL      := 1       show the charge level when the radio is on charge 
ENABLE_REVERSE_BAT_SYMBOL     := 1       mirror the battery symbol on the status bar (+ pole on the right)
#ENABLE_SINGLE_VFO_CHAN       := 1       not yet implemented - single VFO on display when possible
#ENABLE_BAND_SCOPE            := 1       not yet implemented - spectrum/pan-adapter
```

# Some other changes made

* Various Quansheng firmware bugs fixed
* Added new bugs
* Finer RSSI bar steps
* Mic menu includes max gain possible
* AM RX everywhere
* Better backlight times (inc always on)
* Nicer/cleaner big numeric font than original Quansheng big numeric font
* Live DTMF decoder option, though the decoder needs some coeff tuning changes to decode other radios it seems
* Various menu re-wordings (trying to reduce 'WTH does that mean ?')
* Extra menu items (including hidden ones)
* plus others

# Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

# Building

To build the firmware, you need to fetch the submodules and then run make:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1
make
```

To compile directly in windows without the need of a linux virtual machine:

```
1. Download and install "gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.exe" from https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm
2. Download and install "gnu_make-3.81.exe" from https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
3. You may (or may not) need to reboot your PC after installing the above
```

Then you can run 'win_make.bat' from the directory you saved this source code too.
You may need to edit the bat file (path to make.exe) depending on where you installed the above two packages too.

I've left some notes in the win_make.bat file to maybe help with stuff.
